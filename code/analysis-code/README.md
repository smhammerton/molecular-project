# analysis-code

This folder contains code to do some simple exploratory analysis on the processed/cleaned data.
The code produces a few tables and figures, which are saved in the `results` folder.

There is some exploratory code, done 3 different ways. For explanations on the 3 different ways, see the readme file in the `processing-code` folder.

There's also an R script with a bit of a statistical analysis. This is only implemented as an R script, no Quarto version.
