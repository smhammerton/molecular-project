  abstract = {Early reviews identified over 20 risk factors associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) including age, familial inheritance, exposure to aluminium, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and associated co-morbidities such as vascular disease and infection. In the light of recent evidence, this review reconsiders these risk factors, identifies those currently regarded as important, and discusses various hypotheses to explain how they may cause AD. Rare forms of early-onset familial AD (EO-FAD) are strongly linked to causal gene mutations, viz. mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin (PSEN1/2) genes. By contrast, late-onset sporadic AD (LO-SAD) is a multifactorial disorder in which age-related changes, genetic risk factors, such as allelic variation in apolipoprotein E (Apo E) and many other genes, vascular disease, TBI and risk factors associated with diet, the immune system, mitochondrial function, metal exposure, and infection are all implicated. These risk factors may act collectively to cause AD pathology: 1) by promoting the liberation of oxygen free radicals with age, 2) via environmental stress acting on regulatory genes early and later in life ('dual hit' hypothesis), or 3) by increasing the cumulative 'allostatic load' on the body over a lifetime. As a consequence, life-style changes which reduce the impact of these factors may be necessary to lower the risk of AD.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition that occurs in two forms, an early-onset form that is genetically determined and a far more common late-onset form that is not. In both cases, the disease results in severe cognitive dysfunction, among other problems, and the lateonset form of the disease is now considered to be the most common cause of dementia among the elderly. While a good deal of research has been focused on elucidating the etiology of the late-onset form for more than two decades, results to date have been modest and have not yet engendered useful therapeutic strategies for cure of the disease. In this review, we discuss the prevalent ideas that have governed this research for several years, and we challenge these ideas with alternative findings suggesting a multifactorial etiology. We review promising newer ideas that may prove effective as therapeutic interventions for late-onset AD, as well as providing reliable means of earlier and more specific diagnosis of the disease process. In the discussions included here, we reference relevant clinical and basic science literature underlying research into disease etiology and pathogenesis, and we highlight current reviews on the various topics addressed.},

Only 5\% of EOAD patients are carrying a pathogenic mutation in one of the AD genes or a apolipoprotein E (APOE) risk allele ε4, most of EOAD patients remain unexplained. Here, we aimed at summarizing the current knowledge of EOAD genetics and its role in ongoing approaches to understand the biology of AD and disease symptomatology as well as developing new therapeutics. Next, we explored the possible molecular mechanisms that might underlie the missing genetic etiology of EOAD and discussed how the use of massive parallel sequencing technologies triggered novel gene discoveries.

Identifying gene-by-environment interactions will be critical to fully understanding disease mechanisms and developing personalized therapeutics, though these interactions are still poorly understood and largely under-studied. Candidate gene approaches have shown that known disease risk variants often regulate response to environmental factors. However, recent improvements in exposome- and genome-wide association and interaction studies in humans and mice are enabling discovery of novel genetic variants and pathways that predict response to a variety of environmental factors.

Despite their increasing application, the genetic and environmental etiology of global PBA indices is unknown. Likewise, the degree to which genetic influences in PBA are longitudinally stable and how PBA changes over time are also unknown. We analyzed data from 734 men from the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging with repeated MRI assessments between the ages 51-72 years. Biometrical genetic analyses "twin models" revealed significant and highly correlated estimates of additive genetic heritability ranging from 59 to 75\%. Multivariate longitudinal modeling revealed that covariation between PBA at different timepoints could be explained by a single latent factor with 73\% heritability. Our results suggest that genetic influences on PBA are detectable in midlife or earlier, are longitudinally very stable, and are largely explained by common genetic influences.},

In the past, these individuals often received a late diagnosis; however, availability of CSF and PET biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease pathologies and incorporation of atypical forms of Alzheimer's disease into new diagnostic criteria increasingly allows them to be more confidently diagnosed early in their illness. This early diagnosis in turn allows patients to be offered tailored information, appropriate care and support, and individualised treatment plans. These advances will provide improved access to clinical trials, which often exclude atypical phenotypes. Research into atypical Alzheimer's disease has revealed previously unrecognised neuropathological heterogeneity across the Alzheimer's disease spectrum. Neuroimaging, genetic, biomarker, and basic science studies are providing key insights into the factors that might drive selective vulnerability of differing brain networks, with potential mechanistic implications for understanding typical late-onset Alzheimer's disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The only conclusive way to diagnose Alzheimer's is to carry out brain autopsy of the patient's brain tissue and ascertain whether the subject had Alzheimer's or any other form of dementia. However, due to the non-feasibility of such methods, to diagnose and conclude the conditions, medical practitioners use tests that examine a patient's mental ability. OBJECTIVE: Accurate diagnosis at an early stage is the need of the hour for initiation of therapy. The cause for most Alzheimer's cases still remains unknown except where genetic distinctions have been observed. Thus, a standard drug regimen ensues in every Alzheimer's patient, irrespective of the cause, which may not always be beneficial in halting or reversing the disease progression. To provide a better life to such patients by suppressing existing symptoms, early diagnosis, curative therapy, site-specific delivery of drugs, and application of hyphenated methods like artificial intelligence need to be brought into the main field of Alzheimer's therapeutics. METHODS: In this review, we have compiled existing hypotheses to explain the cause of the disease, and highlighted gene therapy, immunotherapy, peptidomimetics, metal chelators, probiotics and quantum dots as advancements in the existing strategies to manage Alzheimer's. CONCLUSION: Biomarkers, brain-imaging, and theranostics, along with artificial intelligence, are understood to be the future of the management of Alzheimer's.},

  abstract = {Background: Dementia risk reduction is a major and growing public health priority. While certain modifiable risk factors for dementia have been identified, there remains a substantial proportion of unexplained risk. There is evidence that environmental risk factors may explain some of this risk. Thus, we present the first comprehensive systematic review of environmental risk factors for dementia. Methods: We searched the PubMed and Web of Science databases from their inception to January 2016, bibliographies of review articles, and articles related to publically available environmental data. Articles were included if they examined the association between an environmental risk factor and dementia. Studies with another outcome (for example, cognition), a physiological measure of the exposure, case studies, animal studies, and studies of nutrition were excluded. Data were extracted from individual studies which were, in turn, appraised for methodological quality. The strength and consistency of the overall evidence for each risk factor identified was assessed. Results: We screened 4784 studies and included 60 in the review. Risk factors were considered in six categories: air quality, toxic heavy metals, other metals, other trace elements, occupational-related exposures, and miscellaneous environmental factors. Few studies took a life course approach. There is at least moderate evidence implicating the following risk factors: air pollution; aluminium; silicon; selenium; pesticides; vitamin D deficiency; and electric and magnetic fields. Conclusions: Studies varied widely in size and quality and therefore we must be circumspect in our conclusions. Nevertheless, this extensive review suggests that future research could focus on a short list of environmental risk factors for dementia. Furthermore, further robust, longitudinal studies with repeated measures of environmental exposures are required to confirm these associations.},

Here, we review evidence that has emerged over the past two decades to explain how environmental factors, such as diet, lifestyle, alcohol, smoking and pollutants, might interact with the human genome. In particular, we discuss how various environmental AD risk factors can induce epigenetic modifications of key AD-related genes and pathways and consider how epigenetic mechanisms could contribute to the effects of oxidative stress on AD onset. Studies on early-life exposures are helping to uncover critical time windows of sensitivity to epigenetic influences from environmental factors, thereby laying the foundations for future primary preventative approaches. We conclude that epigenetic modifications need to be considered when assessing G\,×\,E interactions in AD.},

  abstract = {Dementia in Alzheimer's disease progresses alongside neurodegeneration1-4, but the specific events that cause neuronal dysfunction and death remain poorly understood. During normal ageing, neurons progressively accumulate somatic mutations5 at rates similar to those of dividing cells6,7 which suggests that genetic factors, environmental exposures or disease states might influence this accumulation5. Here we analysed single-cell whole-genome sequencing data from 319 neurons from the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and neurotypical control individuals. We found that somatic DNA alterations increase in individuals with Alzheimer's disease, with distinct molecular patterns. Normal neurons accumulate mutations primarily in an age-related pattern (signature A), which closely resembles 'clock-like' mutational signatures that have been previously described in healthy and cancerous cells6-10. In neurons affected by Alzheimer's disease, additional DNA alterations are driven by distinct processes (signature C) that highlight C{$>$}A and other specific nucleotide changes. These changes potentially implicate nucleotide oxidation4,11, which we show is increased in Alzheimer's-disease-affected neurons in situ. Expressed genes exhibit signature-specific damage, and mutations show a transcriptional strand bias, which suggests that transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair has a role in the generation of mutations. The alterations in Alzheimer's disease affect coding exons and are predicted to create dysfunctional genetic knockout cells and proteostatic stress. Our results suggest that known pathogenic mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease may lead to genomic damage to neurons that can progressively impair function. The aberrant accumulation of DNA alterations in neurodegeneration provides insight into the cascade of molecular and cellular events that occurs in the development of Alzheimer's disease.},

A majority of cases manifest as a late onset sporadic form but genetically the disease is divided into familial cases and sporadic cases. The familial form is due to mutations in three major genes (amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene, presenilin1 (PSEN1) gene and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) gene). In contrast, many genetic and environmental factors may contribute to determining the sporadic AD form. Despite many years of research and great progress in the knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of AD, a full understanding of the etiology of the sporadic form is still not yet in reach. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) revealed the genetic complexity of the disease and recent studies suggested that epigenetic mechanisms may play an essential role in disease development.

Among the increasing number of genetic risk factors identified, the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene remains the strongest and most prevalent, impacting more than half of all AD cases. While the ε4 allele of the APOE gene significantly increases AD risk, the ε2 allele is protective relative to the common ε3 allele. These gene alleles encode three apoE protein isoforms that differ at two amino acid positions. The primary physiological function of apoE is to mediate lipid transport in the brain and periphery; however, additional functions of apoE in diverse biological functions have been recognized. Pathogenically, apoE seeds amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques in the brain with apoE4 driving earlier and more abundant amyloids. ApoE isoforms also have differential effects on multiple Aβ-related or Aβ-independent pathways. The complexity of apoE biology and pathobiology presents challenges to designing effective apoE-targeted therapeutic strategies. This review examines the key pathobiological pathways of apoE and related targeting strategies with a specific focus on the latest technological advances and tools.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Sequencing efforts to identify genetic variants and pathways underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) have largely focused on late-onset AD although early-onset AD (EOAD), accounting for ∼10\% of cases, is largely unexplained by known mutations, resulting in a lack of understanding of its molecular etiology. METHODS: Whole-genome sequencing and harmonization of clinical, neuropathological, and biomarker data of over 5000 EOAD cases of diverse ancestries. RESULTS: A publicly available genomics resource for EOAD with extensive harmonized phenotypes. Primary analysis will (1) identify novel EOAD risk loci and druggable targets; (2) assess local-ancestry effects; (3) create EOAD prediction models; and (4) assess genetic overlap with cardiovascular and other traits. DISCUSSION: This novel resource complements over 50,000 control and late-onset AD samples generated through the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). The harmonized EOAD/ADSP joint call will be available through upcoming ADSP data releases and will allow for additional analyses across the full onset range. HIGHLIGHTS: Sequencing efforts to identify genetic variants and pathways underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) have largely focused on late-onset AD although early-onset AD (EOAD), accounting for ∼10\% of cases, is largely unexplained by known mutations. This results in a significant lack of understanding of the molecular etiology of this devastating form of the disease. The Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Whole-genome Sequencing Project is a collaborative initiative to generate a large-scale genomics resource for early-onset Alzheimer's disease with extensive harmonized phenotype data. Primary analyses are designed to (1) identify novel EOAD risk and protective loci and druggable targets; (2) assess local-ancestry effects; (3) create EOAD prediction models; and (4) assess genetic overlap with cardiovascular and other traits. The harmonized genomic and phenotypic data from this initiative will be available through NIAGADS.},

  abstract = {Age, apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE) and chromosomal sex are well-established risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD; AD). Over 60\% of persons with AD harbor at least one APOE-ε4 allele. The sex-based prevalence of AD is well documented with over 60\% of persons with AD being female. Evidence indicates that the APOE-ε4 risk for AD is greater in women than men, which is particularly evident in heterozygous women carrying one APOE-ε4 allele. Paradoxically, men homozygous for APOE-ε4 are reported to be at greater risk for mild cognitive impairment and AD. Herein, we discuss the complex interplay between the three greatest risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, age, APOE-ε4 genotype and chromosomal sex. We propose that the convergence of these three risk factors, and specifically the bioenergetic aging perimenopause to menopause transition unique to the female, creates a risk profile for AD unique to the female. Further, we discuss the specific risk of the APOE-ε4 positive male which appears to emerge early in the aging process. Evidence for impact of the triad of AD risk factors is most evident in the temporal trajectory of AD progression and burden of pathology in relation to APOE genotype, age and sex. Collectively, the data indicate complex interactions between age, APOE genotype and gender that belies a one size fits all approach and argues for a precision medicine approach that integrates across the three main risk factors for Alzheimer's disease.},

  abstract = {Along with advanced age and apolipoprotein E (APOE)-4 genotype, female sex is a major risk factor for developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Considering that AD pathology begins decades prior to clinical symptoms, the higher risk in women cannot simply be accounted for by their greater longevity as compared to men. Recent investigation into sex-specific pathophysiological mechanisms behind AD risk has implicated the menopause transition (MT), a midlife neuroendocrine transition state unique to females. Commonly characterized as ending in reproductive senescence, many symptoms of MT are neurological, including disruption of estrogen-regulated systems such as thermoregulation, sleep, and circadian rhythms, as well as depression and impairment in multiple cognitive domains. Preclinical studies have shown that, during MT, the estrogen network uncouples from the brain bioenergetic system. The resulting hypometabolic state could serve as the substrate for neurological dysfunction. Indeed, translational brain imaging studies demonstrate that 40-60 year-old perimenopausal and postmenopausal women exhibit an AD-endophenotype characterized by decreased metabolic activity and increased brain amyloid-beta deposition as compared to premenopausal women and to age-matched men. This review discusses the MT as a window of opportunity for therapeutic interventions to compensate for brain bioenergetic crisis and combat the subsequent increased risk for AD in women.},

  abstract = {Early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD), which presents in patients younger than 65 years, has frequently been described as having different features from those of late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD). This review analyses the most recent studies comparing the clinical presentation and neuropsychological, neuropathological, genetic, and neuroimaging findings of both types in order to determine whether EOAD and LOAD are different entities or distinct forms of the same entity. We observed consistent differences between clinical findings in EOAD and in LOAD. Fundamentally, the onset of EOAD is more likely to be marked by atypical symptoms, and cognitive assessments point to poorer executive and visuospatial functioning and praxis with less marked memory impairment. Alzheimer-type features will be more dense and widespread in neuropathology studies, with structural and functional neuroimaging showing greater and more diffuse atrophy extending to neocortical areas (especially the precuneus). In conclusion, available evidence suggests that EOAD and LOAD are 2 different forms of a single entity. LOAD is likely to be influenced by ageing-related processes.},
