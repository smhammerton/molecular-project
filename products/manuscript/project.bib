  abstract = {Background Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) can vary by type and subtype. Over the past decade, the test-negative design has emerged as a valid method for estimation of VE. In this design, VE is calculated as 100\%\hphantom{,}×\hphantom{,}(1\hphantom{,}–\hphantom{,}odds ratio) for vaccine receipt in influenza cases versus test-negative controls. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate VE by type and subtype. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed and Embase from Jan 1, 2004, to March 31, 2015. Test-negative design studies of influenza VE were eligible if they enrolled outpatients on the basis of predefined illness criteria, reported subtype-level VE by season, used PCR to confirm influenza, and adjusted for age. We excluded studies restricted to hospitalised patients or special populations, duplicate reports, interim reports superseded by a final report, studies of live-attenuated vaccine, and studies of prepandemic seasonal vaccine against H1N1pdm09. Two reviewers independently assessed titles and abstracts to identify articles for full review. Discrepancies in inclusion and exclusion criteria and VE estimates were adjudicated by consensus. Outcomes were VE against H3N2, H1N1pdm09, H1N1 (pre-2009), and type B. We calculated pooled VE using a random-effects model. Findings We identified 3368 unduplicated publications, selected 142 for full review, and included 56 in the meta-analysis. Pooled VE was 33\% (95\% CI 26–39; I2=44·4) for H3N2, 54\% (46–61; I2=61·3) for type B, 61\% (57–65; I2=0·0) for H1N1pdm09, and 67\% (29–85; I2=57·6) for H1N1; VE was 73\% (61–81; I2=31·4) for monovalent vaccine against H1N1pdm09. VE against H3N2 for antigenically matched viruses was 33\% (22–43; I2=56·1) and for variant viruses was 23\% (2–40; I2=55·6). Among older adults (aged {$>$}60 years), pooled VE was 24\% (−6 to 45; I2=17·6) for H3N2, 63\% (33–79; I2=0·0) for type B, and 62\% (36–78; I2=0·0) for H1N1pdm09. Interpretation Influenza vaccines provided substantial protection against H1N1pdm09, H1N1 (pre-2009), and type B, and reduced protection against H3N2. Vaccine improvements are needed to generate greater protection against H3N2 than with current vaccines. Funding None.},

  abstract = {Worldwide, infections by influenza viruses are considered a major public health challenge. In this study, influenza B vaccine mismatches and clinical aspects of Victoria and Yamagata infections in Brazil were assessed. Clinical samples were collected from patients suspected of influenza infection. In addition, sociodemographic, clinical, and epidemiological information were collected by the epidemiological surveillance teams. Influenza B lineages were determined by real-time RT-PCR and/or Sanger sequencing. In addition, putative phylogeny–trait associations were assessed by using the BaTS program after phylogenetic reconstruction by a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (BEAST software package). Over 2010–2020, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata-like lineages co-circulated in almost all seasonal epidemics, with B/Victoria predominance in most years. Vaccine mismatches between circulating viruses and the trivalent vaccine strains occurred in five of the eleven seasons (45.5\%). No significant differences were identified in clinical presentation or disease severity caused by both strains, but subjects infected by B/Victoria-like viruses were significantly younger than their B/Yamagata-like counterparts (16.7 vs. 31.4 years, p {$<$} 0.001). This study contributes to a better understanding of the circulation patterns and clinical outcomes of B/Victoria- and B/Yamagata-like lineages in Brazil and advocate for the inclusion of a quadrivalent vaccine in the scope of the Brazilian National Immunization Program.},

A central pillar of this model is the Evolutionary Infectivity Profile, which captures the relationship between immune selection and pathogen transmission.},

We prove that the NEME problem is NP-hard. In addition, we present some heuristic and approximation algorithms for solving the NEME problem, including a polynomial time algorithm that yields a binary, rooted tree whose NEME score is within O(log2⁡n) of the optimum.},

  abstract = {The 2017–2018 North American influenza season caused more hospitalizations and deaths than any year since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The majority of recorded influenza infections were caused by A(H3N2) viruses, with most of the virus’s North American diversity falling into the A2 clade. Within A2, we observe a subclade which we call A2/re that rose to comprise almost 70 per cent of A(H3N2) viruses circulating in North America by early 2018. Unlike most fast-growing clades, however, A2/re contains no amino acid substitutions in the hemagglutinin (HA) segment. Moreover, hemagglutination inhibition assays did not suggest substantial antigenic differences between A2/re viruses and viruses sampled during the 2016–2017 season. Rather, we observe that the A2/re clade was the result of a reassortment event that occurred in late 2016 or early 2017 and involved the combination of the HA and PB1 segments of an A2 virus with neuraminidase (NA) and other segments a virus from the clade A1b. The success of this clade shows the need for antigenic analysis that targets NA in addition to HA. Our results illustrate the potential for non-HA drivers of viral success and necessitate the need for more thorough tracking of full viral genomes to better understand the dynamics of influenza epidemics.},

The principle of this method is to find pairs of operational taxonomic units (OTUs [= neighbors]) that minimize the total branch length at each stage of clustering of OTUs starting with a starlike tree. The branch lengths as well as the topology of a parsimonious tree can quickly be obtained by using this method. Using computer simulation, we studied the efficiency of this method in obtaining the correct unrooted tree in comparison with that of five other tree-making methods: the unweighted pair group method of analysis, Farris's method, Sattath and Tversky's method, Li's method, and Tateno et al.'s modified Farris method. The new, neighbor-joining method and Sattath and Tversky's method are shown to be generally better than the other methods.},

  abstract = {At the start of the 2019–2020 influenza season, concern arose that circulating B/Victoria viruses of the globally emerging clade V1A.3 were antigenically drifted from the strain included in the vaccine. Intense B/Victoria activity was followed by circulation of genetically diverse A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses that were also antigenically drifted. We measured vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the United States against illness from these emerging viruses.We enrolled outpatients aged ≥6 months with acute respiratory illness at 5 sites. Respiratory specimens were tested for influenza by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Using the test-negative design, we determined influenza VE by virus subtype/lineage and genetic subclades by comparing odds of vaccination in influenza cases versus test-negative controls.Among 8845 enrollees, 2722 (31\%) tested positive for influenza, including 1209 (44\%) for B/Victoria and 1405 (51\%) for A(H1N1)pdm09. Effectiveness against any influenza illness was 39\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 32–44), 45\% (95\% CI: 37–52) against B/Victoria and 30\% (95\% CI: 21–39) against A(H1N1)pdm09-associated illness. Vaccination offered no protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses with antigenically drifted clade 6B.1A 183P-5A+156K HA genes (VE 7\%; 95\% CI: –14 to 23\%) which predominated after January.Vaccination provided protection against influenza illness, mainly due to infections from B/Victoria viruses. Vaccine protection against illness from A(H1N1)pdm09 was lower than historically observed effectiveness of 40\%–60\%, due to late-season vaccine mismatch following emergence of antigenically drifted viruses. The effect of drift on vaccine protection is not easy to predict and, even in drifted years, significant protection can be observed.},

Here, we presented a novel modeling framework based on changes in amino acid sequences and relevant epidemiological data to retrospectively investigate the competitive evolution and transmission of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses in the United States during October 2002 and April 2019. To do so, we estimated the time-varying disease transmission rate from the reported influenza cases and the time-varying antigenic change rate of the viruses from the changes in amino acid sequences. By incorporating the time-varying antigenic change rate into the transmission models, we found that the models could capture the evolutionary transmission dynamics of influenza viruses in the United States. Our modeling results also showed that the antigenic change of the virus plays an essential role in seasonal influenza dynamics.},
